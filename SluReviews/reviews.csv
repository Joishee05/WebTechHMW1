We ordered a sampler platter and every item was 5 stars. Family owned and operated. Will definitely be back.","Wow. MUST GO eat here!

That’s all I can say. 
We flew in to Dallas hungry… looked up food on Instagram and their posts convinced us to take an Uber there. 

There was a line to get in at 7pm!
We knew we found a gem. 

It was incredible. 
The food had a kick but so delicious and worth every bit of it. 

Absolutely recommend","My friend recommended Cris and John, a place she had been too a few years back, and it is as popular as ever.  At 6 p.m., it was packed and tons of to-go orders as well.  The line to order moves slowly but it moves.  

We ordered a variety of dishes, loving almost all of them (and had lots of leftovers boxed for lunch the next day).  I loved the chicken egg rolls with sweet and sour sauce.  My friend was overwhelmed by the sheer size of her chicken spring roll, just loaded with vegetables and a very nice peanut sauce.  My next dish was Five-Spice Honey Glazed Chicken Skewers (2) which were really delicious but a bit overcooked.  The side sauce added back moisture and lots of flavor.  

I also ordered a single Sweet Drama Bao Bun with shredded short rib beef.  Delicious!  My friend enjoyed her Basic Chick Taco, which came with light cream sauce.

When we departed, I noticed that the line to order was as long as it was when we walked in 40 minutes before.  This place is on the map for sure!

Two final thoughts:  1) At night, parking is tight, but people do leave and spots open up.  Do not park in a space that belongs to another business!  and 2) Service by those bringing out the food and quickly cleaning up the tables is outstanding!","Heard much about Cris and John — got the Birria and Phorrito Platter to go. Everything was so so good… including the Bang Bang Wings, Spicy Chilli Wings, Korean Fries topped with a fried egg and Angry Broth for dipping 😋🌯🌮","Was feening for a Vietnamese coffee closest to my house and accidentally discovered this new Vietnamese spot . Decided to give it a try with the food . Parking lot was packed and limited at lunch time. Line was also long for ordering. Ordered the pho beef noodle soup with brisket (amazing) . Broth needs a little more flavor. The spicy wings is not spicy and bland , the beef meatball on the skewers was pretty good, the ramen burrito was decent enough. The Vietnamese ice coffee is terrible and tasteless. Nothing close to Vietnamese coffee , believed they need some condense milk in there. All in all average food here.","Excellent pho. Family Had short rib pho and chicken pho. Broth is amazing. I really enjoyed the phoritto but needed the extra egg rolls or I still would have been hungry.","If I lived closer, I'd go here every day. The food is ridiculously good and so satisfying. I tried the ramen burrito, street fries, and cheesy corn, all were delicious! Most of all, you get a lot of food for the price! Will definitely go again.","Really great food, with generous portions and bold flavors.  Try the horchata with coffee-flavored boba - it's a great combination.","We kept seeing this place when we'd stop to pick up Redbox movies, but they were closed on Saturdays. Finally stopped by on a Sunday to try their pho and were not disappointed. Very picky about my pho broth, and theirs has a great depth of flavor, all the herbs and spices are faintly present without being overwhelming. Then we tried their specialty, the phoritto. Another smash! Little by little, we've tried pretty much everything on the menu in the past year and haven't been disappointed once. So much flavor in every item on the menu, but my personal favorite is anything involving their fish - the taco, bun, or banh mi. I don't know what they put in their fish, but I would literally eat it every day if I could. The fact that the staff is so welcoming and helpful is just icing on the fantabulous cake that is Vietnamese fusion food!","Approximately our 5th visit over the last 6 months... always fresh and tasty! The Phorrito is a fave, as well as the Ramenrrito. The crispy wrapper and fresh veggies inside combined with noodles and yummy tender meat is truly different, but delicious! Tried the Bang Bang wings today and they did not disappoint. Crispy with a slightly sweet & spicy sauce. Their broth has the fresh flavor of ginger and basil and pairs well with the noodles and dumplings that come in the Dumpling Soup. Staff is always friendly and ready to help! I give it 4 paws up 🐾🐾!","A fantastic Vietnamese fusion restaurant. Serving Vietnamese street food with a twist such as ramen burritos or Vietnamese quesadillas. Everything I’ve tried has been delicious but my favorites are the fishin’ good tacos an bahn mi . Little spicy an a little sweet while still salty to keep everything in proportion, the fishin’ good is fantastic. I can’t stop going back. Service has be very nice also an prepares food quickly.","and not just the dumplings.  The Bao is delicious there are so many choices it is hard to decide but the Korean  steak was excellent.  it is a tough choice between the Vietnamese coffee and the Thai tea.  this is a bit tricky to find as it is set back in the parking lot.  that said there is plenty of parking.","Where to start?  Best broth I have ever had despite eating in hundreds of fine dining establishments worldwide.  Amazing tacos.  Pho-rito is terrific.  Complementary cucumber water that mixes quite well with the food.  Very clean, staff is always extremely polite and helpful.  Glad it is 15 minutes from home or I would be eating here every other day.  Very reasonable prices and great portion sizes.  They have not skimped on anything critical to having a great successful restaurant, with the exception of the location.  Was blown away, expecting good food, but every trip has yielded extraordinary cuisine.","Wasn't sure about trying korean fusion. That doubt is now gone. Loved it. Staff were extremely helpful as i had never had this kind of food before. I was reasonably sure what i was getting as I ordered. Although i think it would have been better to get the regular sized Phorrito. Turned out to be too much food for me. Taste was extraordinary. Perfect mix of ingredients. Each complemented the other. I don't get over here often, but will definitely keep this place in mind when I am in the area.","Went here at the recommendation of a friend and enjoyed it so much I went back a week later with my daughter.

The first time I had the Phoritto which has seared Steak, basil, cilantro, bean sprouts, jalapenos, red onion, rice noodles, hoison and sriracha sauce wrapped in a flour tortilla. I added the side of Broth.

On my second trip I had the Phodilla which has Grilled Marinated Steak, mozzarella cheese, basil, cilantro, bean sprouts, jalapenos, onions, rice noodles, hoison and sriracha sauce, folded into a flour tortilla.

Both were excellent and I can highly recommend them.  The large size was enough to have half for dinner and save the other half for lunch the next day.","Written April 6, 2024","Written December 29, 2023","Written November 16, 2023","Written October 15, 2023","Written October 6, 2021","Written September 1, 2020","Written April 18, 2020","Written December 20, 2019","Written April 21, 2019","Written April 13, 2019","Written February 14, 2019","Written February 6, 2019","Written August 9, 2018","Written August 2, 2018","Written June 3, 2018"
