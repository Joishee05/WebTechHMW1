        <p>Get in line at least 15-20 minutes before they open because this place is DELICIOUS!!!
        We ordered a sampler platter and every item was 5 stars. Family owned and operated. Will definitely be back.</p>

        <p>Wow. MUST GO eat here! Thatâ€™s all I can say.
        We flew in to Dallas hungryâ€¦ looked up food on Instagram and their posts convinced us to take an Uber there.
        There was a line to get in at 7pm! We knew we found a gem. The food had a kick but so delicious and worth every bit of it.
        Absolutely recommend.</p>

        <p>My friend recommended Cris and John, a place she had been too a few years back, and it is as popular as ever.
        At 6 p.m., it was packed and tons of to-go orders as well. The line to order moves slowly but it moves.
        We ordered a variety of dishes, loving almost all of them (and had lots of leftovers boxed for lunch the next day).
        ... Service by those bringing out the food and quickly cleaning up the tables is outstanding!</p>

        <p>Heard much about Cris and John â€” got the Birria and Phorrito Platter to go.
        Everything was so so goodâ€¦ including the Bang Bang Wings, Spicy Chilli Wings, Korean Fries topped with a fried egg and Angry Broth for dipping ðŸ˜‹ðŸŒ¯ðŸŒ®</p>

        <p>Was feening for a Vietnamese coffee closest to my house and accidentally discovered this new Vietnamese spot.
        Parking lot was packed and limited at lunch time. Ordered the pho beef noodle soup with brisket (amazing).
        The spicy wings were bland, but the beef meatball skewers were good. Ramen burrito was decent.
        Coffee could be improved. All in all, average food here.</p>
